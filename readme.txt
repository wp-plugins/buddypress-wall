Using Child Theme of the BP Default ?

If you use a child theme for buddypress default theme, you must costumise the plugin template for your theme.

By copying /wp-content/plugins/buddypress-wall/includes/templates/bp-default/ to your WordPress theme you can override the template that comes with the plugin. 

The files template will be placed in the buddypress activity,groups and members directory.

9 template should be customised :

activity/activity-wall-loop.php
activity/entry-wall.php
activity/index-wall.php
activity/post-wall-form.php


groups/single/activity-wall.php
groups/single/home-wall.php

members/single/activity-wall.php
members/single/home-wall.php


For example, to update the activity/activity-wall-loop.php template, 
open the template file in your favorite editor or IDE and open the template 
activity/activity-loop.php (without -wall-) and replacing the template activity-wall-loop.php 
by code from activity-loop.php and keeping only the bp-wall php code (marked between <!-- bp-wall-start --> and <!--bp-wall-end-->) in the activity-wall-loop.php.

for example in activity-wall-loop.php, the
code 
<?php bp_wall_load_sub_template( array( 'activity/activity-wall-loop.php' ) ); ?>

is used to load activity-wall-loop.php instead this code
<?php locate_template( array( 'activity/activity-loop.php' ), true ); ?>
used in the default buddypress template.

so you must replace the template content and keep the bp-wall script.
